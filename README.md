This is a Foundry VTT module for pulling *every* player to a specific scene. If you have a large party and they are across various scenes, this adds a shortcut to pull the part together quickly  and easily.

2. Click "Install Module"

# Usage

When bringing up the context menu in the scene navigation bar or directory tab, you can click **Pull All To Scene** to grab everyone currently in the game and put them onto the target scene.
